Learning how to merge

If merge is not pushed: git reset --hard master/origin 


If merge is pushed (deletes history)
                    git reflog master 
                    git reset --hard <commit number before merge>
                    git push --f

If merge is pushed (keeps history)
                    git revert -m 1 (Commit id of the merge commit)
