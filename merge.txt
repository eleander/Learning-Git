What if I want to undo a merge?

<<<<<<< HEAD
It is quite easy to fix merge conflicts with Vs Code
=======
If merge is not pushed: git reset --hard master/origin 


If merge is pushed (deletes history)
                    git reflog master 
                    git reset --hard <commit number before merge>
                    git push --f

If merge is pushed (keeps history)
                    git revert -m 1 commit_hash
