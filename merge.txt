Learning how to merge

If merge is not pushed: git reset --hard master/origin 


If merge is pushed (deletes history)
                    git reflog master 
                    git reset --hard <commit number before merge>
                    git push --f

If merge is pushed (keeps history)
                    git revert -m 1 (Commit id of the merge commit)
Note: The git revert will revert the changes but will keep the history.
Therefore you will not be able to continue working in the same branch 
since you cannot see the actual difference between the merged branch 
and your feature branch anymore.
